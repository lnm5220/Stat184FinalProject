# Stat 184 Final Project

## Leah Miller

- For my final project I chose to work with data that was related to healthcare in some sense. I two datasets, the first being an insurance dataset that showed billed charges for americans dependent on a few factors like region, bmi, sex. That dataset can be found here: *insert link* The second dataset I chose was a google dataset that showed searches of health conditions split by location and search. I was interested in seeing the link between how much a region pays on average vs how much they search for health conditions. My thought was that maybe if a region pays more they would be more likely to search a condition before going to the doctors.
